2. RELEASE NOTES

This release works with Kilmer Peak (Intel® Centrino® Advanced-N +
WiMAX 6250) and Echo Peak (Intel® WiMAX/WiFi Link 5350 and 5150). The
software here is not meant for commercial use and should be treated as
experimental. WiMAX based devices typically need to go through
rigorous carrier certification tests to be endorsed. Please contact
Intel [linux-wimax@intel.com] if you need an officially supported
WiMAX product.

 - i6x50 (Kilmer Peak) support

 - Open source supplicant: see http://linuxwimax.org/Download/#1.5 for
   instructions on building the WPA libeap.so library.

Known issues: 

 - Sometimes a normal scan ('wimaxcu scan') won't show all networks,
   especially MVNOs. Issue a wide scan 'wimaxcu scan wide') to
   workaround. 

See CHANGELOG for more details

* wimax-tools >= 1.4.3
* Linux kernel >= 2.6.35
* WPA open source supplicant (see http://linuxwimax.org/Download/#1.5)
