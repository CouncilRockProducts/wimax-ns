FAQ
---

1. Installing libnl (netlink library)

   Most of major Linux distros provide libnl package through their package 
   management system. For example, in Fedora Core:

   $ yum install libnl libnl-devel   


2. Installing wimax-tools

   wimax-tools is also available through the distro's pacakge management system.
   In Fedora Core 10:

   $ yum install wimax-tools wimax-tools-devel wimax-tools-lib


3. Configure failed due to missing header like `wimax.h`

   In order to compile the wimax-network-service, you must have source of wimax
   driver. The wimax driver is available from kernel 2.6.29.
